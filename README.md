# FacialAttendance
Sounds interesting right? Why not try it once?
<br>
## Overview:
This is an application developed using python. In this pandemic situation, we all are stuck inside our rooms. It has made us so very lazy that we don't even want to attend the online classes from the comfort of our own bedrooms. As I skipped my online classes, I was thinking about those teachers who tirelessly take our attendence everyday. Even though they know the attendence is very poor, they have to call rolls starting from 0 to end, and marking them manually on either a hard copy or saving a soft copy in the computer. 
## Usage:
This project is my small effort to make this tedious task of taking attendence  an automated one, where one individual just needs to place a blank "csv" file every morning where the attendence is stored by the application automatically. Also, this is not only for online purpose, this software can also be used during offline classes. This software can be integrated with a camera in the entrance of a classroom or any room, and one has to stand for 1 second facing towards the camera and his/her attendance will be recorded.
## Installation:
Installing this software isn't a big deal for techies like you, but this may trouble some users depending on their system. Thus we encourage everyone to follow the steps given below to ensure a hazardless and clean installation.

run pip install -r requirements.txt

and to execute
