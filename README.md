Sounds interesting right? Why not try it once?
<br>
## Overview:
This is an application developed using python. In this pandemic situation, we all are stuck inside our rooms. It has made us so very lazy that we don't even want to attend the online classes from the comfort of our own bedrooms. As I skipped my online classes, I was thinking about those teachers who tirelessly take our attendence everyday. Even though they know the attendence is very poor, they have to call rolls starting from 0 to end, and marking them manually on either a hard copy or saving a soft copy in the computer. 
## Usage:
This project is my small effort to make this tedious task of taking attendence an **automated** one, where one individual just needs to place a blank "csv" file every morning where the attendence is stored by the application automatically. Also, this is not only for **online** purpose, this software can also be used during **offline** classes. This software can be integrated with a camera in the entrance of a classroom or any room, and one has to stand for 1 second facing towards the camera and his/her attendance will be recorded.
## Installation:
Installing this software isn't a big deal for techies like you, but this may trouble some users depending on their system. Thus we encourage everyone to follow the steps given below to ensure a hazardless and clean installation. We recommend everyone to skip the steps which are already satisfied by your system.
### NOTE: A laptop with camera or a desktop with webcam is mandatory to use this software.
### Step 1:
Visit [python website](https://www.python.org/), download and install the latest version of python available for your computer system.

### Step 3:
Open Visual Studio installer and download "**Desktop Development with C++**" package.

### Step 4: 
_pip_ installer is required to install the packages required in this software. We recommend you to read this [documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).

### Step 5:
Open the folder in which you downloaded the project, open a terminal in that directory and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` command. If all the previous steps are followed correctly, this command will install and setup the software in your computer system. It will need some time based on your system hardware, but for sure the software will be ready to use.

### Step 6:
Place the pictures of the candidates in file `ImageAttendance` With the names of the candidate as the file name of the picture (.jpeg/.jpg)
(Sample images of Bill Gates, Elon Musk and Satya Nandella provided for demo usage. 

### Step 7:
Run this command in a terminal in that directory, `python attendance.py`. Allow the software to use your camera or webcam and enjoy the creation.
